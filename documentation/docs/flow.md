Perfect — since your goal is both **learning deeply** and **building a working SQL-like database**, here's a step-by-step **development roadmap** that reflects the real architecture of something like SQLite — but simplified to match your 3–7 day project window if you're consistent.

---

## 🧭 Project Roadmap: `MiniDB` (Learning + Building Focus)

### 🟦 **Phase 1: Project Setup + REPL Loop (1–2 hrs)**

> Goal: Create a working CLI that reads user input.

* [x] Set up project with CMake (✔️ Done)
* [x] Create `main.cpp` with REPL loop
* [ ] Add simple command dispatcher (`exit`, unrecognized)

---

### 🟩 **Phase 2: Frontend – Lexical + Syntactic Parsing (3–4 hrs)**

> Goal: Parse SQL-like commands into internal `Command` objects.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Create a **`Command` struct** with type + arguments
* [ ] Implement a **Lexer** to split input string into tokens
* [ ] Build a basic **Parser** to detect `INSERT`, `SELECT`, etc.
* [ ] Create error handling for malformed input

✅ Output:
`INSERT 1 John` → `Command { INSERT, [1, John] }`

---

### 🟨 **Phase 3: Backend – Row, Table, Storage Layer (4–5 hrs)**

> Goal: Store and retrieve rows using in-memory data structures.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Define a `Row` structure (`id`, `name`)
* [ ] Implement a `Table` class:

  * In-memory storage (e.g., vector/map)
  * Methods: `insert(row)`, `select_all()`
* [ ] Link parser output to table commands

✅ Output:
You can `INSERT` and `SELECT` from memory!

---

### 🟥 **Phase 4: File Persistence (Optional but Valuable – 4+ hrs)**

> Goal: Save table to disk and reload on restart.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Use file I/O to write/read rows
* [ ] Format: Binary serialization or plain text
* [ ] Add command like `SAVE` or `AUTOSAVE`

---

### 🟦 **Phase 5: Indexing with B-Trees or std::map (Advanced – 3–4 hrs)**

> Goal: Enable fast row lookup by ID

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Replace vector with `std::map<int, Row>`
* [ ] (Optional) Implement your own basic B-Tree structure
* [ ] Benchmark: Compare linear vs. indexed search

---

### 🟩 **Phase 6: Advanced Parsing – AST, Planning (Optional – 3–6 hrs)**

> Goal: Introduce structure and extensibility to SQL parsing

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Define a simple `AST` node structure
* [ ] Implement a parser to convert tokens → AST
* [ ] Execute AST using a command dispatcher

✅ You'll now have a *real compiler frontend*!

---

### 🟥 **Phase 7: Bytecode Interpreter (Mini VM) (Optional – 6+ hrs)**

> Goal: Compile commands to bytecode and interpret them

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Design bytecode instruction set (`OP_INSERT`, etc.)
* [ ] Write bytecode compiler (parser → bytecode)
* [ ] Implement a mini VM to execute bytecode

---

### ✅ Final Touches

* [ ] Add logging (`std::cout` or log file)
* [ ] Add CLI colors (for fun)
* [ ] Add tests (`test_insert.cpp`, etc.)
* [ ] Add README + GitHub project

## 🌱 Learning Path Breakdown

| Phase | Learning Focus                            |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1     | CMake, project structure, I/O             |
| 2     | Compilers: lexing, parsing, token streams |
| 3     | Memory layout, data structures, OOP       |
| 4     | File I/O, persistence                     |
| 5     | Indexing, tree structures                 |
| 6     | ASTs, extensible parsing                  |
| 7     | Bytecode, VM design (CS heavy)            |
